        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a 1st year student at the University of California Riverside. I was previously a Sociology major, but I am now pursuing an education in Business Administration. At the University of California Riverside, I am currently enrolled in CHASS (the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences)
        . In the future, I will transfer into the School of Business at UCR to further pursue my education in this field. My GPA as of now is 4.0, which I hope to maintain throughout the entirety
        of my Freshman year. I am also a member of the Honors College at UC Riverside, and will be pursing a capstone project with a professor of my choice in my junior and senior years. I hope to continue my education at the University of California Riverside throughout my full degree, and I look forward to all
        of the opportunities this school can bring me. <br><br>

      I am currently employed by UCR in the position of IT Asset Assistant Manager, and have previous work experience with retail and within the food industry.
        I was employed by Michaels Stores from 2020 to 2021, and I worked as a sales associate. My duties included answering calls pertaining to stock checks and merchandise information, organizing the merchandise, cleaning the store, cash and credit transactions,
        and customer service interactions. I then began employment with Boba Guys from 2021 to 2022. I was employed as a Barista and my duties included, taking out the trash, cleaning the kitchen and service area, preparing drinks and ingredients, customer service interactions, and
        cash and card transactions.<br><br>
        I have also completed various forms of volunteer work in the past that consist of helping out with dog adoptions, cleaning a children's art and science center, and assisting the community with sorting cans and packages for food drives. At Doggie Protection Services,
        I would sit with the dogs in a cage while potential adopters would look around and ask for information about the animals. I would also clean them, walk them, and feed them to ensure they were healthy while in the process of potentially being adopted. A typical shift here was around 4-8 hours. At Oakland's Junior Center of Art and Science I volunteered to clean the area up.
        This included vaccuming carpets, wiping down tables, sanitizing areas, washing dishes and craft supplies, and more. This work was roughly two hours. Lastly, when volunteering for Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, I would sort
        through bins of donated food products such as cans and other various packages, check for damages and expiration dates, and get the products ready to be given back to the community.<br><br>
